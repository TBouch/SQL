#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
Select count(orderID) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales;


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
Select count(orderID) 
from BIT_DB.JanSales 
Where Product = 'iPhone';


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
Select customers.acctnum 
from BIT_DB.customers 
inner join BIT_DB.FebSales
on customers.order_id = FEbSales.orderID;


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
Select DISTINCT product, price
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Where price IN (Select Min(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales);


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
Select SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
from BIT_DB.JanSales
Group by product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
Select Sum(Quantity), product,  Sum(Quantity) * price as revenue 
from BIT_DB.FebSales
Where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
Group by product;


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
Select count(customers.acctnum),
Avg(Quantity*price) 
from BIT_DB.FebSales 
left join BIT_DB.customers
on customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID 
where FebSales.Quantity > 2;
